# 🌿 Greenify

**Collaborators:** 4 team members  
**Event:** Milli Hakaton  

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

Greenify encourages children and young people to protect the environment, increase their knowledge about ecology, and take small but meaningful eco-friendly actions in their daily lives.

---

## 🧠 Project Idea

Greenify is a gamified mobile or web application.  
Users complete ecological tasks, earn points, and can become an “Eco Leader.” Each activity represents a real-life eco-friendly habit.

---

## ⚙ Key Features

### 1. 🧩 Tasks Section
- “Reuse 1 plastic bottle” → +10 points  
- “Join a campaign to plant 10 trees” → +100 points  
- Simple behavioral tasks like “Don’t disturb an ant nest”

### 2. 🏅 Rankings & Rewards
- Users level up through bronze, silver, and gold Eco Leader ranks.  
- Monthly certificates or badges for top leaders (virtual or printable).

### 3. 🌍 Map System
- “Clean Areas Map” — users can mark locations where they have collected trash.  
- “Help Out!” — shows nearby cleanup or tree-planting events.

### 4. 🧒 Greenify for Kids
- Simplified version: mini-games that teach sorting trash, recognizing animals, planting trees, etc. (“Sort the Trash!”).  
- Multiple difficulty levels: easy, medium, hard.

### 5. 💬 Educational Content
- Short videos and quizzes (“Which material decomposes faster?”, “Ways to save water”).  
- Extra points awarded for correct answers.
